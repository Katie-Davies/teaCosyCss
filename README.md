# Flexbox Practice 

This was a project where I had to use solely flexbox to create the given design brief below.

I came across a few challenges when trying to make my page responsive and also ensuring I applied the right styling to the correct div. 

## My process 

After reviewing the brief I found it easiest to break the brief down into sections and work on each piece at a time. 
Then for each section I would physically draw on a piece of paper the layout I think I would need to achieve the design. This meant drawing the number of divs, adding what styling I think each div would need based on its content and how I needed it to look. 
Then I would transfer this to my code, making sure I would look at my preview before moving on to the next part to make sure I knew when a bug occurred.
